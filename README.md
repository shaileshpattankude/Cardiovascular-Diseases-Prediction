# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

A machine learning–powered web application that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease based on health parameters. The system analyzes user inputs and provides an instant prediction to support early risk awareness and timely medical attention.

What This Project Does
The application predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease using:
- Medical and lifestyle information (e.g., age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc.)
- A machine learning model trained on a real-world dataset
The prediction helps users understand risk probability so they can take preventive steps.

Why This Project Was Built
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and many cases go undetected due to lack of early awareness. Most people do not consult a doctor until symptoms become serious.

This project was built to:
- Provide a **quick, accessible screening tool**
- Increase **health awareness** using technology
- Encourage **early consultation** and prevent delayed diagnosis

The system does **not** replace medical evaluation — it helps people identify risk and take timely preventive action.

 Problem Statement
> How can we help individuals **assess their heart disease risk easily and instantly** using their health data?
Traditional diagnosis requires tests, medical visits, and time. Many individuals avoid checkups until late stages.

This system solves the issue by:
- Accepting health parameters through a simple web form
- Using a trained ML model to estimate disease probability
- Displaying prediction results immediately in a user-friendly manner

🛠 Tech Stack
- Language: Python  
- Framework: Flask  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn  
- Data Handling: Pandas  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  

 Model Details (High-Level)
- Trained on a dataset of **~78,680 previous patient records**
- Achieved **~97% prediction accuracy**
- Uses supervised learning algorithms for binary classification

🧾 How the System Works
1. User enters health data through a structured input form
2. Data is preprocessed and fed into the trained ML model
3. The model predicts whether the user is at risk of cardiovascular disease
4. The result is shown on the screen with a clear indication of risk status
